# GIF ZOO!
What the project does:
This project uses an API provided by GIPHY API to search for and populate up to 10 gifs related to the animal selected. If any one of the GIFs is clicked, they will go from a still frame state to their animated gif state. If clicked again, you can stop the animated state to make it still again. There is an option to search for a new animal that would populate a new button, that would populate the gifs like the default buttons. Unfortunately, this portion of the assignment is still being worked on. However, everything else checks out!

Why the project is useful:
Helps us get familiar with API's and the use of AJAX. It also takes us further into jQuery with new methods being introduced. We also learn how to maneuver through objects called from API's in the form of JSON.

How users can get started with the project:
Just click any one of the buttons to populate the GIFs. You can then click the GIF to animate it!
